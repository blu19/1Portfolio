            Welcome everyone! I look forward to meeting you if I haven't already. 
            My name is Brian Ulatowski and this is my first basic portfolio website. 
            I graduated from Cal State University Northridge in 2005 with a BA in 
            Liberal Studies and a focus in teaching math and a Teaching Credential. 
            I have taught for 14 years, in public and private schools, including charter 
            schools and internationally in Cambodia, Vietnam and Costa Rica. I've taught 
            mostly math subjects, but have also taught English as a Second Language, 
            History, Language Arts, Science, Humanities, as well as other stuff. 
            Currently, I'm taking a full stack web development program via Trilogy at 
            UCLA Extension. My hope is that I can transition into a career in web 
            development.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, 
            especially my wife. I enjoy traveling to different places, especially 
            places that speak different languages and have different cultures than 
            what we are used to here in the US. I've had the privilege of traveling 
            through more than 25 different countries. Usually budget travel. Once flew 
            round trip to Guatemala from Los Angeles for $72 including tax. I've been 
            turned down for a job because I didn't look 'American enough.' I've moved 
            a lot more than most; more times than years I've been alive. I do my best 
            to stay active and get in exercise several times each week, as it helps me 
            to maintain my sanity. I'm extremely afraid of heights. I am a very picky 
            eater, but I love to eat and I also love to cook, but my actual cooking 
            skills are still progressing. I enjoy watching movies and shows, especially 
            realistic dramas or comedies. I care about people and the community around 
            me. 
        </p>

            This hopefully gives you a little insight to me. Please feel free to reach 
            out to ask me any questions about myself or web development stuff.
